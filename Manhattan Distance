/*Quering the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places*/

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

The STATION table is described as follows:

                  Station
               Field | Type
               ID    | Number
               City  | Varchar2 (21)
               State | Varchar2(2)
               LAT_N | Number
               LONG_W| Number

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

/*values*/
Max(LAT_N) from station = 144.98906270
Min(LAT_N) from station = 25.07352606
Max(LONG_W) from station = 164.87604770
Min(LONG_W) from station = 25.10565434

/* Query */
Select Round(Max(lat_n)-Min(lat_N) + Max(long_w)-Min(long_w),4) from station;
