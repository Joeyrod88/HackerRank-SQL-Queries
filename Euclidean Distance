/*Quering the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places*/

Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values
of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

The STATION table is described as follows:

                  Station
               Field | Type
               ID    | Number
               City  | Varchar2 (21)
               State | Varchar2(2)
               LAT_N | Number
               LONG_W| Number

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

/*values*/
Max(LAT_N) from station = 144.98906270
Min(LAT_N) from station = 25.07352606
Max(LONG_W) from station = 164.87604770
Min(LONG_W) from station = 25.10565434


/* Query */
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POWER(MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N),2) + POWER(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W),2)), 4) FROM STATION;

/* Results*/
184.1616
